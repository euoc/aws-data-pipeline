# Security Implementation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the AWS Data Pipeline project.

## Overview

The AWS Data Pipeline follows security best practices for cloud-based applications, with a focus on:

- Secure network design
- Least privilege access control
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Secret management
- Secure configuration

## Network Security

### VPC Configuration

- **Multi-tier network architecture**:
  - Public subnet: Only for NAT Gateway
  - Private subnet: For ECS Fargate tasks with outbound internet access
  - Isolated subnet: For RDS PostgreSQL with no internet access

- **Security Groups**:
  - Database security group allows inbound only from ECS tasks
  - ECS tasks have outbound internet access for package updates

## Identity and Access Management

### IAM Roles and Policies

- **Task Execution Role**: Limited permissions for ECS to:
  - Pull container images
  - Write logs to CloudWatch
  - Read secrets from Secrets Manager

- **Task Role**: Limited permissions for the application to:
  - Read from specific S3 bucket
  - Connect to the specific RDS instance

- **Least Privilege Principle**: All roles follow the principle of least privilege

## Data Security

### Encryption

- **S3 Bucket**:
  - Server-side encryption with S3-managed keys
  - Versioning enabled
  - Public access blocked

- **RDS Database**:
  - Storage encryption enabled
  - Transport encryption via SSL/TLS

- **Data in Transit**:
  - Enforced SSL/TLS between all components

### Secret Management

- **Database Credentials**:
  - Stored in AWS Secrets Manager
  - Rotated automatically
  - Never exposed in code or configuration files

## Compliance and Best Practices

- **AWS Well-Architected Framework**: Follows the security pillar recommendations
- **OWASP**: Follows applicable recommendations for secure application design
- **CIS Benchmarks**: Follows applicable AWS security benchmarks

## Security Monitoring and Logging

- **CloudWatch Logs**: All container logs stored in CloudWatch
- **AWS CloudTrail**: Enabled for API activity monitoring
- **RDS Logs**: Database logs captured and stored

## Secure Development Practices

- **Code Reviews**: Required for all changes
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning for vulnerable dependencies
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure defined as code and version controlled

## Security Testing

- **Automated Security Testing**: Part of the CI/CD pipeline
- **Regular Security Reviews**: Scheduled reviews of the security configuration
