# Testing Guide for AWS Data Pipeline

This document describes the testing approach and procedures for the AWS Data Pipeline project.

## Testing Strategy

The project implements multiple testing levels:

1. **Unit Tests**: For individual components of the CDK infrastructure and application code
2. **Integration Tests**: For the interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Tests**: For the entire pipeline

## Unit Testing

Unit tests validate individual components in isolation:

### CDK Infrastructure Tests

The CDK infrastructure is tested using the AWS CDK testing framework to ensure that:

- All required resources are created
- Resources have the correct configurations
- Security settings are properly applied

To run the CDK infrastructure tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Application Unit Tests

The Python application is tested using pytest:

```bash
cd app
python -m pytest tests/unit/
```

## Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that the components work together correctly:

1. Set up a local testing environment
2. Deploy the infrastructure to a test AWS account
3. Validate the interactions between components

## End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests validate the entire pipeline:

1. Deploy the complete stack to a test environment
2. Upload test data to the S3 bucket
3. Verify that the data is processed and stored in RDS correctly

## Security Testing

Security tests ensure that:

- IAM permissions follow the principle of least privilege
- S3 buckets are not publicly accessible
- Database connections are properly secured
- Secrets are properly managed

## Test Data

Sample test data is available in the `samples/` directory.

## Continuous Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated testing on each pull request:

1. Run unit tests
2. Synthesize the CDK stack
3. Validate the CloudFormation template
4. Run security scanning on the infrastructure code
